
% Phase naming in TauP
% 
% A major feature of the TauP Toolkit is the implementation of a phase name parser that allows the user to define
% essentially arbitrary phases through the earth. Thus, the TauP Toolkit is extremely flexible in this respect since it
% is not limited to a pre-defined set of phases. Phase names are not hard-coded into the software, rather the names
% are interpreted and the appropriate propagation path and resulting times are constructed at run time. Designing a
% phase-naming convention that is general enough to support arbitrary phases and easy to understand is an essential
% and somewhat challenging step. The rules that we have developed are described here. Most of phases resulting
% from these conventions should be familiar to seismologists, e.g. pP, PP, PcS, PKiKP, etc. However, the uniqueness
% required for parsing results in some new names for other familiar phases.
%
% In traditional "whole-earth" seismology, there are 3 major interfaces: the free surface, the core-mantle boundary,
% and the inner-outer core boundary. Phases interacting with the core-mantle boundary and the inner core boundary
% are easy to describe because the symbol for the wave type changes at the boundary (i.e. the symbol P changes
% to K within the outer core even though the wave type is the same). Phase multiples for these interfaces and the
% free surface are also easy to describe because the symbols describe a unique path. The challenge begins with
% the description of interactions with interfaces within the crust and upper mantle. We have introduced two new
% symbols to existing nomenclature to provide unique descriptions of potential paths. Phase names are constructed
% from a sequence of symbols and numbers (with no spaces) that either describe the wave type, the interaction a
% wave makes with an interface, or the depth to an interface involved in an interaction.
% 
% 1. Symbols that describe wave-type are:
%   P compressional wave, upgoing or downgoing, in the crust or mantle
%   p strictly upgoing P wave in the crust or mantle
%   S shear wave, upgoing or downgoing, in the crust or mantle
%   s strictly upgoing S wave in the crust or mantle
%   K compressional wave in the outer core
%   I compressional wave in the inner core
%   J shear wave in the inner core
% 
% 2. Symbols that describe interactions with interfaces are:
%   m interaction with the moho
%   g appended to P or S to represent a ray turning in the crust
%   n appended to P or S to represent a head wave along the moho
%   c topside reflection off the core mantle boundary
%   i topside reflection off the inner core outer core boundary
%   ˆ underside reflection, used primarily for crustal and mantle interfaces
%   v topside reflection, used primarily for crustal and mantle interfaces
%     diff appended to P or S to represent a diffracted wave along the core mantle boundary
%     kmps appended to a velocity to represent a horizontal phase velocity (see 10 below)
% 
% 3. The characters p and s always represent up-going legs. An example is the source to surface leg of the phase
% pP from a source at depth. P and S can be turning waves, but always indicate downgoing waves leaving
% the source when they are the first symbol in a phase name. Thus, to get near-source, direct P-wave arrival
% times, you need to specify two phases p and P or use the "ttimes compatibility phases" described below.
% However, P may represent a upgoing leg in certain cases. For instance, PcP is allowed since the direction
% of the phase is unambiguously determined by the symbol c, but would be named Pcp by a purist using our
% nomenclature.
% 
% 4. Numbers, except velocities for kmps phases (see 10 below), represent depths at which interactions take
% place. For example, P410s represents a P-to-S conversion at a discontinuity at 410km depth. Since the
% S-leg is given by a lower-case symbol and no reflection indicator is included, this represents a P-wave
% converting to an S-wave when it hits the interface from below. The numbers given need not be the actual
% depth, the closest depth corresponding to a discontinuity in the model will be used. For example, if the time
% for P410s is requested in a model where the discontinuity was really located at 406.7 kilometers depth,
% the time returned would actually be for P406.7s. The code "taup time" would note that this had been
% done. Obviously, care should be taken to ensure that there are no other discontinuities closer than the one of
% interest, but this approach allows generic interface names like "410" and "660" to be used without knowing
% the exact depth in a given model.
% 
% 5. If a number appears between two phase legs, e.g. S410P, it represents a transmitted phase conversion, not
% a reflection. Thus, S410P would be a transmitted conversion from S to P at 410km depth. Whether the
% conversion occurs on the down-going side or up-going side is determined by the upper or lower case of the
% following leg. For instance, the phase S410P propagates down as an S, converts at the 410 to a P, continues
% down, turns as a P-wave, and propagates back across the 410 and to the surface. S410p on the other hand,
% propagates down as a S through the 410, turns as an S, hits the 410 from the bottom, converts to a p and then
% goes up to the surface. In these cases, the case of the phase symbol (P vs. p) is critical because the direction
% of propagation (upgoing or downgoing) is not unambiguously defined elsewhere in the phase name. The
% importance is clear when you consider a source depth below 410 compared to above 410. For a source depth
% greater than 410 km, S410P technically cannot exist while S410p maintains the same path (a receiver side
% conversion) as it does for a source depth above the 410.
%
% The first letter can be lower case to indicate a conversion from an up-going ray, e.g. p410S is a depth
% phase from a source at greater than 410 kilometers depth that phase converts at the 410 discontinuity. It is
% strictly upgoing over its entire path, and hence could also be labeled p410s. p410S is often used to mean
% a reflection in the literature, but there are too many possible interactions for the phase parser to allow this.
% If the underside reflection is desired, use the pˆ 410S notation from rule 7.
% 
% 6. Due to the two previous rules, P410P and S410S are over specified, but still legal. They are almost
% equivalent to P and S, respectively, but restrict the path to phases transmitted through (turning below) the
% 410. This notation is useful to limit arrivals to just those that turn deeper than a discontinuity (thus avoiding
% travel time curve triplications), even though they have no real interaction with it.
% 
% 7. The characters ˆ and v are new symbols introduced here to represent bottom-side and top-side reflections,
% respectively. They are followed by a number to represent the approximate depth of the reflection or a letter
% for standard discontinuities, m, c or i. Reflections from discontinuities besides the core-mantle boundary, c;
% or inner-core outer-core boundary, i, must use the ˆ and v notation. For instance, in the TauP convention,
% pˆ 410S is used to describe a near-source underside reflection.
% Underside reflections, except at the surface (PP, sS, etc.), core-mantle boundary (PKKP, SKKKS, etc.), or
% outer-core-inner-core boundary (PKIIKP, SKJJKS, SKIIKS, etc.), must be specified with the ˆ notation.
% For example, Pˆ 410P and Pˆ mP would both be underside reflections from the 410km discontinuity and
% the Moho, respectively.
%
% The phase PmP, the traditional name for a top-side reflection from the Moho discontinuity, must change
% names under our new convention. The new name is PvmP or Pvmp while PmP just describes a P-wave that
% turns beneath the Moho. The reason the Moho must be handled differently from the core-mantle boundary is
% that traditional nomenclature did not introduce a phase symbol change at the Moho. Thus, while PcP makes
% sense since a P-wave in the core would be labeled K, PmP could have several meanings. The m symbol just
% allows the user to describe phases interaction with the Moho without knowing its exact depth. In all other
% respects, the ˆ -v nomenclature is maintained.
% 
% 8. Currently, ˆ and v for non-standard discontinuities are allowed only in the crust and mantle. Thus there
% are no reflections off non-standard discontinuities within the core, (reflections such as PKKP, PKiKP and
% PKIIKP are still fine). There is no reason in principle to restrict reflections off discontinuities in the core,
% but until there is interest expressed, these phases will not be added. Also, a naming convention would have
% to be created since "p is to P" is not the same as "i is to I".
% 
% 9. Currently there is no support for PKPab, PKPbc, or PKPdf phase names. They lead to increased algorithmic
% complexity that at this point seems unwarranted. Currently, in regions where triplications develop, the
% triplicated phase will have multiple arrivals at a given distance. So, PKPab and PKPbc are both labeled
% just PKP while PKPdf is called PKIKP.
% 
% 10. The symbol kmps is used to get the travel time for a specific horizontal phase velocity. For example, 2kmps
% represents a horizontal phase velocity of 2 kilometers per second. While the calculations for these are trivial,
% it is convenient to have them available to estimate surface wave travel times or to define windows of interest
% for given paths.
% 
% 11. As a convenience, a ttimes phase name compatibility mode is available. So ttp gives you the phase list
% corresponding to P in ttimes. Similarly there are tts, ttp+, tts+, ttbasic and ttall.
