%
% plotRFgather_azim( time, seis , rayp, baz, atimes, nrf , amp, isReg)
%
% time is a cell array of time arrays
% seis is a cell array of seis arrays
% baz is an array of back azimuths in radians
% atimes is a cell array of teleseismic arrival times
% nrf is the number of receiver fuctions
% amp is the gain to add to the signals
% isReg = True indicates regularly spaced

%-- Code:

% get the plot limits
mint = min( [time{:}] );

maxt = max( [time{:}] );

% get the order of rfns based on back azimuth
[tmpb, idx] = sort( baz );

% compute the normalization for amplitudes
nmz = 0.0;
for irf = 1:nrf,
  nmz = max( [nmz, max( abs(seis{idx(irf)}) )]); % normalization factor
end

% plot the receiver functions for this station ordered by back azimuth
hold on;
for irf = 1:nrf,
  if(isReg)
    xpos = irf - 0.5;
    text(xpos,mint(1),num2str(baz(idx(irf)),'%.1f'),'Rotation',90)
    set(gca,'XTick',[]);
  else
    xpos =  baz(idx(irf));
    set(gca,'XAxisLocation','top','FontSize',24)
    xlabel('Back Azimuth (^o)','FontSize',24)
  end
  
  % plot the coloured trace
  plotseis( xpos + amp*seis{idx(irf)}/nmz, time{idx(irf)} , xpos, 'r' , 'b')


  text(xpos,maxt(1),num2str(rayp(idx(irf)),'%.3f'),'Rotation',270)  

  % plot the arrival times
  
  
  if nargin > 7
      times = atimes{ idx(irf) };
      times = times( times >= time{idx(irf)}(1) & times <= time{idx(irf)}(end));
