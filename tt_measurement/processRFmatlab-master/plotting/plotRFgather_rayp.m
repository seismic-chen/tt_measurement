% plotRFgather_rayp( time, seis , rayp, baz, nrf , amp, isReg, atimes)
%
% time is a cell array of time arrays
% seis is a cell array of seis arrays
% baz is an array of back azimuths in radians
% atimes is a cell array of teleseismic arrival times
% nrf is the number of receiver fuctions
% amp is the gain to add to the signals
% isReg = True indicates regularly spaced
