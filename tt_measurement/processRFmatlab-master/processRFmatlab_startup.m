%PROCESSRFMATLAB_STARTUP is a simple script to put the functions into
% your path.  You need to manually set the root directory to wherever
% you saved the codes.  If you want to have access to the functions
% every time you start matlab, put the code in this script into your
% startup.m file which is in your userpath (type userpath to find out
% where that is).

%-- Change Log:
%
%

% The following two lines will work if you put these codes
% directly into your matlab userpath.
tmp_userpath = char(userpath);
processRFmatlab_root = fullfile( tmp_userpath(1:end), ...
                                'processRFmatlab-master');
%
% Otherwise you can hard code it. For example, comment out the above
% two lines and add
% processRFmatlab_root='/Users/yunfeng/MATLAB/processRFmatlab-master';
% on linux, or for windows
% >> processRFmatlab_root='C:\directory\where/you\saved\processRFmatlab'
%
% In my case...
% processRFmatlab_root=['/home/iwbailey/seismology/programs/' ...
%                     'processRFmatlab'];


% Check the directory exists
if ~exist(processRFmatlab_root, 'dir'),
    error('You need to edit this script to point to your directory')
    return;
end

% Now add the paths for all the functions individually
fprintf('Adding deconvolution functions to path\n');
addpath(fullfile(processRFmatlab_root,'deconvolution'));

fprintf('Adding depthmapping functions to path\n');
addpath(fullfile(processRFmatlab_root,'depthmapping'));

fprintf('Adding getinfo functions to path\n');
addpath(fullfile(processRFmatlab_root,'getinfo'));

fprintf('Adding inout functions to path\n');
addpath(fullfile(processRFmatlab_root,'inout'));

fprintf('Adding plotting functions to path\n');
addpath(fullfile(processRFmatlab_root,'plotting'));

fprintf('Adding signalprocessing functions to path\n');
addpath(fullfile(processRFmatlab_root,'signalprocessing'));

fprintf('Adding velocity models to path\n');
addpath(fullfile(processRFmatlab_root,'velmodels1D'));

% Clean up variables
clear processRFmatlab_root;
